    tranplantTitle:'What is Hair Transplant?',
    transplantContent: `A Hair Transplant is a permanent and natural micro-surgical procedure applied in hair loss caused by the activity of hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors that directly affect the person. Without harming the health of the donor area(back of the head) and existing hair follicles, the grafts taken by micromotor are transferred to the determined areas by FUE or DHI method. When transplanting the grafts from the donor area(back of the head) to the targetted area, an adaptatıon process takes place. As the grafts need to adjust to the transplanted area. The method applied should be suitable to the patient’s case in order to have successful results. Turkey Hair Transplant can be applied to every person who has sufficient donor area and whose general health condition is favorable. Performed with 3 different procedures, two different methods can also be applied in a single session. The procedures to be considered after the decision of the appropriate method in the Hair Transplant operation are communicated to the person before the procedure. The process that starts with the operation continues with dressing and 10-day washing, while the healing accelerates after the scab shedding as of the 10th day, and the adaptation process begins. Although Hair Transplant Turkey is suitable for people over the age of +18, hair loss in the first 1 – 1.5 months after the operation is also subject to the process. While the existing hair in the transferred grafts is shedding and preparing the ground for regeneration, the roots should be supported with vitamins and care supplements such as PRP – Mesotherapy – AGF 39 in this process.    `,
