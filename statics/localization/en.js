    tranplantTitle:'What is Hair Transplant?',
    transplantContent: `A Hair Transplant is a permanent and natural micro-surgical procedure applied in hair loss caused by the activity of hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors that directly affect the person. Without harming the health of the donor area(back of the head) and existing hair follicles, the grafts taken by micromotor are transferred to the determined areas by FUE or DHI method. When transplanting the grafts from the donor area(back of the head) to the targetted area, an adaptatıon process takes place. As the grafts need to adjust to the transplanted area. The method applied should be suitable to the patient’s case in order to have successful results. Turkey Hair Transplant can be applied to every person who has sufficient donor area and whose general health condition is favorable. Performed with 3 different procedures, two different methods can also be applied in a single session. The procedures to be considered after the decision of the appropriate method in the Hair Transplant operation are communicated to the person before the procedure. The process that starts with the operation continues with dressing and 10-day washing, while the healing accelerates after the scab shedding as of the 10th day, and the adaptation process begins. Although Hair Transplant Turkey is suitable for people over the age of +18, hair loss in the first 1 – 1.5 months after the operation is also subject to the process. While the existing hair in the transferred grafts is shedding and preparing the ground for regeneration, the roots should be supported with vitamins and care supplements such as PRP – Mesotherapy – AGF 39 in this process.    `,

    dhiFueTitle:'DHI - FUE Hair Transplant Method',
    DhiFue:`
    <p>DHI hair transplantation is one of the most popular methods to treat hair loss. The most distinctive feature of the technique is the Choi pencil. Thanks to these special pens, grooving and hair transplant are performed at the same time. However, it is a process that takes a little more time and requires more experience than the FUE technique. Specialists place the hair follicles one by one. Insertion is an extremely delicate process. The doctor implants the hair follicles optimally at an angle of 40-45 degrees. Apart from the angle, another important aspect is the correct direction following the previous hairline. In order for the hair to be combed in the desired direction, the angle given to the hair directions is very important, this process should be performed in reliable hands. Petra Hair family is pleased to serve you in this field.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>DHI Hair; Cultivation Advantages</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It increases the success rate up to 98% after hair transplantation.</li>
        <li>There is almost no incision in this method.</li>
        <li>Hair follicles are easier to protect.</li>
        <li>It helps you achieve more natural hair.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is a faster recovery after the surgery, so the patient quickly returns to his daily routine in a short time.</p>
    <p>FUE Hair Transplant Stages</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>FUE hair transplantation is one of the most preferred methods today, as it replaced the FUT technique, which was accepted as the milestone of hair transplantation in 1988.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><br></li>
        <li>Hair follicles from the donor area are separated from the tissue by means of a micromotor without damaging the hair follicle. These roots coming out of the donor area are then collected by the operator.</li>
        <li>To prepare the grafts for planting, another specialist first lines the collected grafts (hair follicles) on a surgical gauze strip.</li>
        <li>Hair follicles cannot survive for long outside our body. Therefore, the grafts are placed in a special serum solution. In this serum solution max. residence time is 24 hours.</li>
        <li>The serum ensures that the hair follicles are protected from environmental effects, especially from dehydration (drying).</li>
        <li>For the grafts taken, channels are opened at the right angle and at appropriate intervals by the Sapphire FUE method in the area to be planted.</li>
        <li>The hair follicles taken into the opened channels are transferred without damaging them.</li>
        <li>However, hair transplant operations take less than 8 hours on average. However, hair transplantation is a specific procedure, so the same period will not be valid for every person. As Petra Hair family, our priority in the service we will give you is to get a good result after hair transplantation.</li>

    <p>Hair Transplantation in Women,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For women, how their hair looks is very important. Lush and lively hair is desired by all women, but hair loss may occur for many reasons such as hormonal irregularities, nutritional disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome. Today, male pattern hair loss can be eliminated with female hair transplantation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The most effective method for women who have experienced intense hair loss is hair transplantation. Hair transplantation in women includes the same stages as classical hair transplantation. Generally, except in exceptional cases, women do not need to shave the planting area while having a hair transplant. Only the donor area, where the hair follicles will be taken, is shaved in a way that is not obvious after sowing. Since women have long hair, the cut area is camouflaged by the hair.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Which method is used in hair transplantation?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Due to regional hair loss or sparse hair in women, transplantation is performed with the DHI-Choi Pen, which makes it possible to plant frequently in small areas. Thanks to the DHI method, natural forehead line design can be made and much thicker hair can be obtained.</p>

trassızHairTransplantDesc:`
<p>If you want to have a hair transplant without cutting your hair, it is not possible to have a hair transplant without shaving first. This situation causes information pollution on the internet and social media. The donor area (neck and ear tops) where the hair follicles will be taken should be shaved. This issue is important in terms of the health of the roots to be transferred and business ethics. However, since it will only be the nape area, this area will be shaped with the help of a hairdresser after sowing and will return to its former state in a short time. In addition, the planting area does not need to be shaved. If you prefer not to shave the planting area, you can clarify whether you are suitable for unshaven planting by getting support from our experts in our Petra Hair family.</p>

pansumanTitle:'Dressing One Day After the Operation',
pansumanDesc:`
<h2>Dressing</h2>
<p>In order to prevent infection of the donor area where the hair follicles are taken after the transplantation and to accelerate the wound healing, the nape area is dressed and this area is closed in a sterile way. The transplant area provides a slower recovery than the donor area, so contact with the transplant area should be avoided during the 10-day period after transplanting. However, although this situation is not the same for the donor area, the dressing in the nape area should be removed on the 2nd day of the operation. This issue is important for the tissue to breathe and heal. Since it is not a problem to contact the donor area, you will not need to go out of your comfort by compromising your sleep after the transplantation and there is no need for a second dressing. It is very important that the donor area breathes.</p>

As a result of these tests, you will be given medication. If you experience a side effect or a negative situation, you should consult your doctor and discontinue the drug.</p>

beardTitle:'Beard and Eyebrow Transplantation',

<p>Beard and Mustache Transplantation Many men who do not have the desired beard and mustache density apply many methods to change this situation. The first to try is usually cosmetic procedures, oils or cures. However, if the person has problems such as general beard loss or regional shedding, these solutions are unfortunately insufficient. Today, the most accurate method for those looking for a permanent solution is beard transplantation and mustache transplantation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many criteria must be met, such as natural planting, planting in accordance with the direction of hair growth, and obtaining the right density.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First of all, you can easily choose the planting method in cases such as sparse hair structure, lack of mustache and beard due to genetic factors, or loss due to wounds and burns. You can get your beard or mustache in a very short time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How is Beard Transplantation and Mustache Transplantation Performed?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After the determination of the number of grafts, the transplantation process proceeds just like in hair transplantation. First, the donor area is locally anesthetized and hair follicle extraction is started. Since the local anesthesia method is applied before mustache transplantation, pain or pain sensation does not occur during transplantation, do not worry about this. Grafts to be transplanted for mustache transplantation are taken one by one and kept in special solutions until planting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Dhi-Choi technique is mostly preferred as a mustache transplant method, but in some cases, the classical FUE method can also be applied.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is normal to develop redness after sowing, and the redness in the area will go away after a maximum of 5 months. Crusting occurs due to the channels opened during sowing. You can experience the crusting process very comfortably with the right beard care. You can speed up your healing process by following the recommended lotion and washing instructions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How is Beard Transplantation Performed?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Beard transplantation method can be done with both methods. Beard transplantation begins with the removal of the grafts from the donor area and is kept in special solutions so that the hair follicles do not die. For beard transplantation, a sufficient number of transplantations should be made on average in the transplantation area, this is determined by the experts. Less graft transplantation creates an unnatural appearance with sparse multi-graft transplantation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first washing of the beard and mustache transplantation area is carried out between 24-48 hours. Since the clots will disappear after the first wash, the beard look starts to look much more natural. In the early stages of beard transplantation, redness and acne-like formations may appear between the beards. Do not worry in this process, you can easily get through this process by consulting our experts in the Petra Hair family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Beards should not be shaved directly in the first period, they should be shortened and shaped after 15 days. After 1 month, the person can shave if he/she wishes. One of the most important points to be considered in beard transplantation and mustache transplantation is that the hair follicles to be planted are planted according to the direction and angle of the hair growth. Otherwise, the mustache stance will not be as desired. The number of hair follicles to be planted; It is determined according to the wishes of the person and the sparseness of the mustache. Since a much thicker beard and mustache appearance is desired by frequent planting, arrangements can be made according to requests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Who Can Have Beard Transplantation and Mustache Transplantation?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sparse beard or mustache can become a problem that cannot be ignored for men. Sowing process in general; It is preferred in cases where there is no regional or whole hair structure due to disease, genetics, medicine, hair loss or similar conditions. Beard transplantation or mustache transplantation can be done at the same time, or only beard or mustache transplantation can be performed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The most important point in planting on the face area is that there should be enough hair follicles in the donor area, as in other plantings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In order to obtain the desired density, density or appearance, the calculation of the number of grafts must be done very well and analyzed. Correct hair analysis is very important to obtain a natural look. Considering the maximum change in appearance in facial transplants, it should be treated very meticulously and transplanted one by one according to the direction of hair growth.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Individual expectations are essential in planting operations. Your planting process should be carried out by experts who will understand your wishes and have sufficient technological equipment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For Natural Appearance After Beard or Mustache Transplantation:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Beard or mustache transplantation is a method obtained with hair follicles, and it will take a very short time for your hair follicles to turn into beard format. After the hair follicles taken from the nape section are transferred to the chin section, a natural appearance will be obtained, and after shaving the transplanted area several times, the hair follicles will thicken and take the beard format.</p>
